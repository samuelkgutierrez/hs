Functions can't begin with uppercase letters

Lists are a homogeneous data structure.

++ List Concatenation

[1, 2, 3] ++ [4]
    ^
    |
   Slow to add at end of large lists

: 'cons' to add to front of list is fast

If you want to get an element out of a list by index, use !!. The indices start
at 0.

*Main> let foo = [0..12]
*Main> foo
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
